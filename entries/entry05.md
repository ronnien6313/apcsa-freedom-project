### Context

After creating the button `transitionThing`, we made it so every function of the game relies on that button. The moment it is clicked, all the users stats will change depending on various factors of the game. One factor that I had to make was a function called `mood`. This `mood` function will randomly give the player a moood every week which will affect the users stats.

### Coding

The first thing I did was make it so the `mood` was viewable in the journal. This was done by going into the `journal` script and simply appending the mood text at the end.

This is how it looked like.

The first thing I did was go into the `initStat` script to add `mood` variable. This allows us to get the `mood` of the player.
