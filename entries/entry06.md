# Entry 6
##### 6/1/23

### Context

After me, my partners Wei Jie and Anson finished our MVP, it was time to create our elevator pitch for our SEP Expo. The SEP Expo is where Seniors and Juniors come together to see each other's creations. It's a pretty cool event where you can meet younger students which made it more relaxed but there were also judges walking around. After the SEP Expo came to our in-class presentation.

### Elevator Pitch

An elevator pitch is a statement about our application to make our participants interested. Here is what our elevator pitch looks like:

```
Good morning! Would you like to experiment with different diets and exercises?

Give a goal for your character and we can use our game to simulate it. 

We made our game in Unity Engine, a platform where developers can make games. The character can plan their diet and exercise and using algorithms I was able to create a relationship between the diets and exercises with the player statistics. 

During the gameplay, random events and mood will affect the character in some way and when the determination drops to zero the character will relapse. 

Our game is on simmer.io if this game is something you would like to try out for yourself.
```

Our elevator pitch first starts with a hook. We then transition to what our game is about and how we made it. Finally, we say how the participant can actually play our game which is through simmer.io.


### In-Class Presentation

Next came the in-class presentation where we had to create [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11ajfFoeoqKRSPMX9b9ycLiQGgvxpchA8KAXkhBB1ST8/edit?usp=sharing) for this presentation. These slides included our hook, code snippets of our game, and our takeaways. Our hook first started with a question that regarded someone's persistence. We then related it to our game where you can test out how it feels to work out. Most of the images on our slides were from pixel sprites we made for our game. This allowed our slides to be a little funny and have an essence of our game on them. Besides images for decoration, we also cropped a few images of our code into the slide. We decided to not fill the slides with words and instead explain all of our code during the presentation.


### Takeaways

I couldn't attend the SEP Expo so I don't really have any takeaways for it. However, I did do the in-class presentation and my takeaway would be that planning out what to say prior to a presentation is extremely important. Me and my partners didn't really plan out what we were going to say or who was going to say what until the last moment. Although we did pull through pretty decently it made me, if not all of us more nervous for the presentation.


### EDP

Currently, we are at stage 8 of the engineering design process. It is the last stage where we communicate the result of our project through our in-class presentation and SEP expo.

### Skills

The skills that I have learned while creating the elevator pitch and delivering the presentation are creativity and organization. Creativity because we wanted to make our slides interesting and creating hooks were actually a lot harder than we thought. Organization because we had to decide how we wanted to organize our slides. We had a few troubles trying to figure out what we should start with and how we should end our presentation.
