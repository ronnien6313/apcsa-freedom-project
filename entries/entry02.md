### Context

In APCSA, after deciding the tool and application I wanted to create, It was time for me to start tinkering with my tool. The first thing I wanted to do was to create a pop-up screen. The goal was to create an object that allowed a small panel to be opened when clicked. While doing this, I learned that there were many functions that was needed in order to make this work. The first function I learned was `onMouseDown()`. This allowed me to perform an action after the button is clicked. The second function I learned was `getComponent()` because I wanted to be able to alter the properties of the object. When combining these two functions, It allowed to me to create panel that could be opened and closed.

### Learning

#### onMouseDown()

The function `onMouseDown()` is relatively simple as it does what the name states.


#### getComponent()

The function `getComponent()` gets the components of the object. Each object has multiple properties to it such as it's text or color and each of these properties are components.
